      "Description": "By default, a GPU will perform texture filtering with the same precision as the stored texture. This causes quality issues for Water where a 16 bit texture is used to store Water and Terrain elevation. This function performs texture filtering manually, so that full 32 bit interpolation can be used. This greatly reduces banding.",
